# Ship Battle :

### Ship Battle was developed as my first python project by me as my third Full Stack Web Development project with Code Institute.

# Reason :
Since Python is a very interesting language easy to use, and unbelievably annoying when it comes to indentations and semi-columns, I've thought a battleship game would be a perfect choice. As a child, I always loved video games so I felt affinity regarding this project, just an amazing experience  

# Battleships

## Is a strategy-type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships is marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

# How to play : 

## Ship Battle is based on the original version of the battleship game. In this terminal version, the user can place 5 different ships vertically and horizontally with a size of 2, 3, 4, 5 while the computer generates a random position on his board, the objective is to hit all 5 enemy ships

# Features :

The Features were designed to be as simple as possible since is a terminal game you don't need much to play

- User name :
    - lets the player freely choose a username of his choice.

- Ships placement :
    - Allows the user to place 5 ships of different sizes vertically and horizontally.
    - Checks the overlap of the ships, so you cant place a ship on the map.
    - Computer randomly places enemy ships.

- Hit/Miss check :
    - Checks if your attack successfully hits a ship or the water

- Calling shots :
  - The player may choose a vertical or horizontal orientation and a number from 1 - 8 to call his shot.
  - Computer does the same by itself.

# Testing :
  - Passed the code through PEP8 and only got line size issues nothing that compromises the game or the code flow.
  - Used a lot of print statements to test every main function of the game.
  - Type error value error and key error were used to check if the expected input was the right input.

 # Test Validators :
  - Passed through PEP8 validation whitout any issues

# Observations :
  ## I have a bad practice that is good to mention, to avoid unnecessary commits I like to code every major part in the Visual studio code so I don't need to commit a lot of things, I thought this was a very good idea at first, but this pushes a lot of inconsistency in my commits.

  ## Special thanks 
  I would like to thank everyone who helped me with this project.

- My mentor.
- My good friend Armandinho.
- Jean my good French friend for all the support and advice.
- Code Institute for giving the best support to develop this project.
