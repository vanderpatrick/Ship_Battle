# Ship Battle :

### Ship Battle was developed as my first python project by me as my third Full Stack Web Development project with Code Institute.

# Reason :
Since Python is a very interesting langues easy to use, and ubelibel annoing when it comes to indentations and semi-columns, i've thought a battleship game would be the perfect choice. As a child i always loved video games so i felt afinity regarding to this project, just an amazing experience  

# Battleships

## Is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

# How to play : 

## Ship Battle is based on the original version of battleship game. This terminal version the user can place 5 differents ships verticaly and horizontaly with size of 2, 3, 4, 5 while the computer generates a random position on his board, the objective is to hit all 5 enemy ships

# Features :

The Features were designed to be as simple as possible since is a terminal game you dont need much to play

- Calling shots :
  - The player may chosse a vertical or horizontal ortientation and a number from 1 - 8 to call his shot.
  - Computer does the same by itself.

# Testing :
  - Passed the code trhough PEP8 and only got line size issues nothing that compromises the game or the code flow.
  - Used alot of print statements to test every main function of the game.
  - Type error value error and key error were used to check if the expect input was acctually the right input.

 # Test Validators :
  - Passed trhough PEP8 validation, with 3 line size issues, that comes beacuse of indentation inside the start game function

# Deployment :
